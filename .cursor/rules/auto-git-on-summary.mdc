# Auto Git on Summary of Changes

When you provide a **summary of changes** to the user at the end of a task, immediately run:

1. **git add** – Stage all changes
2. **git commit** – Commit with the summary as the commit message (use emoji + concise description)
3. **git push** – Push to the remote

## Workflow

After completing edits and summarizing what was done:

```bash
git add -A
git status   # verify staged files
git commit -m "📝 Brief summary of changes"
git pull --rebase origin main  # if needed (handle remote changes)
git push
```

## Commit Message Format

- Use emoji + short description (e.g., `🖼️ Add RealScout widget to layout`, `🐛 Fix navigation dropdown`)
- Keep under ~72 characters
- Derive from the summary you provided to the user

## When to Run

- **Always** when you've made file changes and provided a summary
- **Skip** if the user explicitly asked not to commit, or if it was a read-only/informational response
