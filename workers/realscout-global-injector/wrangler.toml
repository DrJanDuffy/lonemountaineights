# realscout-global-injector — Cloudflare Worker
#
# Lazy-loads RealScout widgets via Intersection Observer and serves the
# RealScout script bundle from the edge (same-origin proxy).
#
# Routes span 135+ zones and are managed by: scripts/deploy-worker-routes.js
# Do NOT add route patterns here — they only support a single zone.
#
# Deploy:
#   cd workers/realscout-global-injector
#   npx wrangler deploy
#
# Dev:
#   npx wrangler dev

# No routes here — managed via API across all zones
# No bindings needed — Worker only uses fetch + cache + HTMLRewriter
